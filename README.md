Verilog - HIT 2024

Implement a traffic light control system using timers and LEDs in Verilog on the Novuton board.
This project involves designing a state machine that controls the timing and sequencing of traffic lights (red, yellow, green) for an intersection.
The Verilog code will manage the transitions between states,
ensuring proper timing intervals for each light.
This project provides hands-on experience with digital design, FPGA programming, and hardware interfacing, offering a practical introduction to embedded systems using the Novuton board.
